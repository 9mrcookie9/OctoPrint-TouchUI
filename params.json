{"name":"TouchUI","tagline":"A touch friendly interface for a small TFT module or phone","body":"# OctoPrint-TouchUI 0.1.0\r\nThis plugin will transform the OctoPrint layout into a Mobile/TFT friendly layout. With larger buttons and a responsive layout down to the smallest resolution possible. It will mimick pointer events as touch, so you can hook up those touchscreens. It also supports a virtual keyboard.\r\n\r\nAll these options are set clientside, so we won't interfere with other clients. All settings are stored in a delicious cookie for up to a year.\r\n\r\nYou can find the TouchUI settings in the `User settings` modal under `TouchUI`. Remember they're stored on your device, so if you login with your desktop computer you won't get the touch interface.\r\n\r\n![TouchUI Interface](https://billyblaze.github.io/OctoPrint-TouchUI/images/touchui.gif)\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nInstall via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)\r\nor manually using this URL:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/BillyBlaze/OctoPrint-TouchUI/archive/master.zip\r\n\r\n#### Additional step for the RaspberryPi\r\n##### Automaticly boot into fullscreen mode with iceweasel:\r\n1.
