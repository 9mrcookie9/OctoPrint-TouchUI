{"name":"TouchUI","tagline":"A touch friendly interface for a small TFT module or phone","body":"# OctoPrint-TouchUI 0.2.0\r\nThis plugin will transform the OctoPrint layout into a Mobile/TFT friendly layout. With larger buttons and a responsive layout down to the smallest resolution possible. It will mimick pointer events as touch, so you can hook up those touchscreens. It also supports a virtual keyboard.\r\n\r\nAll these settings are set clientside, so we won't interfere with other clients. All settings are stored in a delicious cookie for up to a year. You can find the `TouchUI settings` in a dedicated modal. Remember they're stored on your device, so if you login with your desktop computer you won't get the touch interface.\r\n\r\nFrom v0.2.0 the interface will automatically start while loading OctoPrint. This will only start if the browser is smaller then 980 pixels in width or if you're browsing with a touch device. You can turn this off in the `Settings` modal under `TouchUI`.\r\n\r\n![TouchUI Interface](https://billyblaze.github.io/OctoPrint-TouchUI/images/touchui.gif)\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nInstall via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)\r\nor manually using this URL:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/BillyBlaze/OctoPrint-TouchUI/archive/master.zip\r\n\r\n#### Additional step for the RaspberryPi\r\n##### Automaticly boot into fullscreen mode with iceweasel:\r\n1.
